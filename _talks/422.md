Have you ever wondered how supply chain problems can be solved using a data driven approach? Or did you even ask yourself
'how hard can it be?' while looking for supermarkets with toilet paper and pasta out of stock during the hoarding caused by
Corona?
This is your chance: Write bots for retailers, wholesalers, distributors and manufacturers and show others that you
master the problem of supply chain! Prove to the world, your bot is the smartest and become famous!

The tournament will run during the entire conference and the winners will be rewarded with prizes in the end.
